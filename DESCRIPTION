Description: The 'Vowpal Wabbit' project is a fast out-of-core learning
 system sponsored by Microsoft Research (having started at Yahoo! Research)
 and written by John Langford along with a number of contributors. This R
 package does not include the distributed computing implementation of the
 cluster/ directory of the upstream sources. Use of the software as a network
 service is also not directly supported as the aim is a simpler direct call
 from R for validation and comparison. Note that this package contains an
 embedded older version of 'Vowpal Wabbit'. The package 'rvw' at the GitHub
 repo <https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rvw> can provide an alternative using 
 an external 'Vowpal Wabbit' library installation.
