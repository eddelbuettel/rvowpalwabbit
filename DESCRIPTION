Description: R interface to Vowpal Wabbit fast out-of-core learning system
 The Vowpal Wabbit (VW) project is a fast out-of-core learning system
 sponsored by Yahoo! Research and written by John Langford along with a
 number of contributors.
 .
 There are two ways to have a fast learning algorithm: (a) start with a slow
 algorithm and speed it up, or (b) build an intrinsically fast learning
 algorithm. This project is about approach (b), and it has reached a state
 where it may be useful to others as a platform for research and
 experimentation.
 .
 There are several optimization algorithms available with the baseline being
 sparse gradient descent (GD) on a loss function (several are available). The
 code should be easily usable. Its only external dependence is on the Boost
 library, which is often installed by default.
 .
 This R package does not include the distributed computing implementation of
 the cluster/ directory of the upstream sources.  Use of the software as a
 network servie is also not directly supported as the aim is a simpler direct
 call from R for validation and comparison.
