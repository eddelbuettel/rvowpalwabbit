### About

A proof-of-concept wrapping of (an earlier version of) Vowpal Wabbit

### Status

It works. It could do with some help. And it should be updated now to use the external VowpalWabbit
library which did not exists when this work was originally done. Collaborators welcome.

It is on CRAN as it works, and sort-of grandfathered. It sadly also reflects
old code. 

A newer attempt is in https://github.com/rvw-org/rvw. And an updated (at
last) upstream web presence is at https://vowpalwabbit.org.
